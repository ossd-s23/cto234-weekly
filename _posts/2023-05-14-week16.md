title: 'Week 16 - Final Final Week'
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't sure if I was expected to write a blog post for this week, but here's a quick one. The last few presentations were great, I really enjoyed seeing everyone's contributions and the wide variety of projects people chose. I think Maple and Linux were some of my favorites for their interesting and detailed presentations, I liked getting insight into these projects and I think these two were especially engaging. The last thing I want to say is thank you. This class has been a joy to be in and one of my most enjoyable CS classes - and I'm not just saying that to get extra points. I will miss my group and looking forward to coming to class every week, it was a very welcoming and pleasant environment and exposed me to a lot of new ideas, so thank you. Have a great summer!x
