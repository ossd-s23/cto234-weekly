title: Week 1: Intro
---


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First week of OSSD done and I'm really looking forward to the next one. I didn't know anything about open source projects before coming into this course except that they were collaborative and available to the public. I didn't know any of the history, but I'm glad we're covering some of it in class because it's pretty interesting. I'm beginning to understand the importance of it, and how open source means more opportunity to grow as there is little to no barrier between someone's ideas and them implementing it.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't realize how many things I use regularly are open source. For example Wikipedia is famously open source, but so is firefox. I also had no idea that Dall-E was open source until filling out the wiki. I think the first open source project I learned about was Linux in middle school, but I don't think I fully understood what that meant at the time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm excited to get introduced to the practical side of Open Source - that is, the part where we find existing projects and try to make helpful changes to them. I've never worked with a large codebase like the ones we're likely to encounter and I'm glad to have this class as a gentle introduction into working with stuff like that. 
Not much more to say other than that as it's only the first week. Until next time.
