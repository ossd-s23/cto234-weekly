title: 'Week 9 - Jim Hall and Start of Group Work'
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talk from Jim Hall was great, I really enjoyed heearing his story - especially his memories of working on older hardware and the sorts of applications and games he used back them. It's always interesting to hear from older programmers about how the process was different before advancements like git and easier communication over the internet. He was a very engaging speaker - so far I've really enjoyed both the guest lectures we've had so far this semester, I hope we have another.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--more--> We've begun working on our group projects properly now. My group has already gotten two PRs approved which I feel is a great start. Both my group members are bilingual and can therefore work on translation work for Free Code Camp. I do not have this skill so I'll have to find code or documentation to work on. I plan to continually check back for more 'beginners only' issues that I can solve, and until then I will look through the other issues to see if there's one I feel that I can tackle. I think I will also go through tutorials and see if there's any bugs or mistakes I can report. Excited to get my first PR approved!
