&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we continued work on our chosen projects. Unfortunately I don't have much to report, but some progress was made. My group came across a issue that we thought we could tackle. The issue is fixing a bug in which the user is not notified when an API fails during the submission of a backend project. I'm currrently in the process of replicating the bug, which unfortunately is fairly complicated as the issue is based on another issue, which in turn is based on another issue, and so on. The chain of issues goes back a few years and therefore offer differing instructions on how to replicate the API failure, and conflicting information. However, once this is worked out, I'm fairly confident I'll be able to fix it, as it's basically just creating a popup with an error message.<!--more-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's pretty intimidating wokring with such a huge codebase, and this is the first time I've worked with so much code, but I think this is really good practice and a great experience to prepare myself for a job in the industry where I will inevitably be working with similarly large and unweildy repos. Overall it has been a challenge, but one that I am determined to complete.
