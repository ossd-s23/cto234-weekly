title: 'Week 6 - Choosing a Project'
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two weeks I've looked at a lot of projects. Many of them were duds; they were inactive, abandoned, or for whatever reason inaccessable. However, I did see a few that I would like to work on. I'm particularly interested in doing some frontend work and using some of the skills I accumulated last semester in AIT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm most excited about getting used to working in a large codebase and working collaboratively with others, both in my group and in the community. I feel as though this is going to be a good approximation of working as a low level software engineer or something at a company, and will  be good experience to have and put on my resume. <!--more-->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the biggest challenge will be having everyone on the group be able to contribute (near) equally. Some poeple will inevitably have more coding skills and some may be better at writing documentation, so it may be possible to divide the work in that way, but I think it may be a challenge to get everyone on the same page and making useful contributions. I think to get over this will simply take a ot of clear communication between everyone to get a feel for people's individual interests and skills to find a clear specialty for each person.
