Week 3: Browser Extensions

This week we did the git activity which was VERY helpful. I used git a fair amount for AIT last semester, but never needed to fork or merge repos - I really only ever cloned, committed, and pushed. Going over pulls and remotes was super helpful and I'm really glad we did that.
My team for the browsr extension is making good progress. We have the repo all set up as an open source project with a license, readme, code of conduct, etc. The only thing we have left to finish is the actual extension, but hopefully that will be finished by the end of the week as well. So far I think my biggest contribution has been organization. I made sure to reach out to the other members and help organize meetings and discussion around deciding our extension project. I also created the actual repo we're using and made a skeleton directory for the parts that we needed. Currently I'm working on getting the search function to work. It's pretty frustrating to be honest. Ive tried a ton of different things and none work. But that's typical programming stuff, so it's nothing new.
